# Getting Started
Migaga uses Slash Commands for administrators, if you're looking to set something up it will probably appear when you type `/` - if it doesn't it will soon!

## Inviting the Bot
You can add Migaga to your server using Discord's invite screen, you will need to have permissions to invite bots.

Use this link:
[https://invite.migaga.info/](https://invite.migaga.info/)

Migaga will ask for the necessary permissions to make all of its features work and nothing more.  
You can choose to uncheck any permissions, but it may cause some commands to malfunction. 

## Setting up your Server
You can use this screen as a checklist of things to set up to get the full benefit.
