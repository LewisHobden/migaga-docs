Concepts This feature has to be enabled by an admin before it can be used. Roles are automatically cleaned up and deleted if the booster stops boosting. Booster roles give no additional permissions, they are purely cosmetic. Booster roles have a concept of an \"anchor role\" which all new roles are placed below - for colour schemes. Getting Started /booster role enable <enabled> Use this command to enable/disable booster roles in your server. Permissions You must have the \"Manage Server\" permission to run this command. Enabled True/False, if you pick \"True\" then booster roles will be enabled for your server members. What to expect Once enabled, your Nitro boosters will be able to provide themselves custom roles using the !br command. /booster role setup <anchor role> Permissions You must have the \"Manage Server\" permission to run this command. Anchor Role When new booster roles are created, they will be placed directly below this role. This is useful if your server already has colourful roles, and you want the booster role to be above it. What to expect Your booster role will be configured for your server, and automatically booster roles will be created above the anchor role. If you did not provide an anchor role it will be removed. /booster role import <user> If your server members already had booster roles before this feature was enabled, you can use this command to add the booster roles to Migaga. Permissions You must have the \"Manage Server\" permission to run this command. User Optionally you can pick a specific user to import roles for. What to expect Migaga will go through all members of your server who boost the server and check their roles. If the member has a role that belongs only to them and is below the Anchor Role (if one exists) then it will be imported for the member to manage for themselves. !boosterrole <instruction> <field> <value> This is the command your server members can use to update their booster role. Aliases Since this is a long command, you can use !br or !myrole instead. Permissions You must boost the server to use this command. Instruction Typically this will be \"set\".

Currently this feature only supports server emoji. This will be changed in a future update - for now using default emoji will get \"Emoji not found\" errors. Getting Started Help Command For more information on reaction flairs inside Discord - use the !help Reaction Flairs command. [Command] New reaction flair Use this command to set up a brand new reaction flair for a message: !rf <message> <emoji> <role> Permissions You must have the \"Manage Roles\" permission to run this command. Message The message that should be set up with this reaction. This should be the message link! For instructions on how to get a message link, read the Discord Docs .

[Command] Deleting a reaction flair !rmrf <reference> Permissions You must have the \"Manage Roles\" permission to run this command. Reference This is the unique reference that has been generated for your reaction flair. You can find out the reference using the rfinfo command . What to expect Migaga will delete the reaction flair immediately. Reactions will not be removed from the message , reacting to the message will no longer give you that flair. FAQs Can I give more than one role per reaction? Yes! Using the rf command multiple times will give/take all roles upon reacting. Can I remove roles using reaction flairs? Yes! Using role overrides you can set up your reactions to remove roles when a user grabs one. Can I make sure people only have one of a certain type of role? Yes!
